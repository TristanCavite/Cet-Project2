                The College of Engineering started as the Department of Agricultural Engineering and Applied Mathematics (DAEAM) when President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Presidential Decree (P.D.) 470 on 24 May 1974 (amended by P.D. 700 on 12 May 1975) converting the then Visayas Agricultural College (VAC) into the Visayas State College of Agriculture (ViSCA) to expand VAC’s curricular programs in agriculture and technology.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                In June 1975, DAEAM offered the first engineering degree program in ViSCA, the Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                In 2001, DAEAM became the College of Engineering and Agro-Industry (CEAI) when ViSCA was converted to Leyte State University (LSU) by virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9158 of 2001. The CEAI was composed of four (4) academic departments namely; the Department of Agricultural Engineering (DAE), Department of Computer Science and Technology (DCST), Department of Food Science and Technology (DFST), and the Department of Business and Management (DBM).  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                In 2009, two (2) years after LSU was converted to the Visayas State University (VSU) by virtue of R.A. No. 947, the CEAI was split into two colleges, the College of Business Management and Economics (CBME) and the College of Engineering (CoE) by akun pro thailand virtue of BOR Resolution No. 74, s. of 2009.  The CoE was composed of the Department of Agricultural Engineering (DAE), Department of Civil Engineering (DCE), Department of Computer Science and Technology (DCST), Department of Geodetic Engineering (DGE, and Department of Mechanical Engineering (DME). In 2018, the College of Engineering (CoE) became the College of Engineering and Technology (CET). 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Currently, the College of Engineering and Technology is composed of six (6) academic departments namely; the Department of Agricultural and Biosystem Engineering (DABE), Department of Civil Engineering (DCE), Department of Computer Science and Technology (DCST), Department of Geodetic Engineering (DGE), and the Department of Mechanical Engineering (DME), Department of Meteorology (DM), and one (1) research center; the Renewable Energy Research Center (RERC). The College is performing four (4) fold functions in instruction, research, extension, and production.
